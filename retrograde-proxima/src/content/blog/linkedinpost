Why Founders Asking Employees to Work 80-Hour Weeks Makes No Sense 🙄🚫



Let’s get real: If you’re a founder or business owner publicly saying employees need to work 60-80 hours a week to succeed, you might want to rethink your approach.



Sure, you’re emotionally and financially invested in your business—it’s your baby. 👶 But employees? They’re here for the paycheck, growth, and work-life balance.



🏡✨ Asking them to adopt a founder’s mindset? That’s like expecting your babysitter to adopt your child.



💡 Here’s the problem with the “work more” mindset:

1️⃣ Employees ≠ Owners. Founders have equity and decision-making power. Employees don’t. Expecting the same commitment is unrealistic.

2️⃣ Burnout hurts your business. Exhausted employees quit, and replacing them is expensive.

3️⃣ It’s often a systems issue. Long hours happen because workflows, priorities, or communication are broken—not because employees aren’t grinding hard enough.



🚨 Overworking people doesn’t solve your problems—it creates new ones.



✅ Here’s what founders should focus on instead:

Streamline operations. Automate repetitive tasks, simplify workflows, and make expectations crystal clear.



Measure results, not hours. Productivity isn’t about how long someone sits at their desk; it’s about outcomes.



Build a culture people want to be part of. Encourage work-life balance and flexibility.



Lead with empathy. Listen to your employees and set a healthy example.



💬 To all the founders out there: Stop projecting your grind onto your employees. A successful business isn’t built on exhaustion—it’s built on efficiency, great systems, and motivated people. 🌟



Let’s ditch the hustle hype and work smarter, not harder. 🛠️✨
