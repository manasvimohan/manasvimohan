🚨 Breaking News: I've Decided to Work 100 Hours a Week! 🚨

No, I’m not starting a rocket company 🚀 or trying to colonize Mars 🌌... I just want to impress startup founders who think 70-80 hours is "grinding."

Because clearly, 40 hours is for the weak, 60 is entry-level, and 80? Do you even hustle, bro? 💪

Here’s the secret: Work 200 hours a week. Sleep? Overrated. Social life? Canceled. Food? Just chew on ambition 🍽️.

In fact, I’m writing this post while dreaming about my next Zoom call 😴. (Efficiency!)

#GrindCulture is officially my cardio. Where’s my gold medal? 🥇

P.S. Totally kidding. Work smart, not like you’ve been possessed by capitalism. ✌️
